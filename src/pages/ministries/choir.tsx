            <h3>Our Choir Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              "Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, praise his name; 
              proclaim his salvation day after day." â€“ Psalm 96:1-2
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that when voices unite in worship, something beautiful happens â€“ hearts are lifted, 
              spirits are encouraged, and God is glorified. Our choir is more than a musical group; we're a 
              community of believers who have found joy in serving God together through song.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Training and Development</h3>
            <p>
              We provide ongoing vocal training, music theory education, and performance coaching to help 
              every member reach their full potential. Our experienced leaders and guest instructors ensure 
              that each member grows both musically and spiritually.
