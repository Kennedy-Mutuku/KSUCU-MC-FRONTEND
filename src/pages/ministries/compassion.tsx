            <h2>About Compassion Ministry</h2>
            <p>
              The Compassion Ministry is dedicated to being the hands and feet of Jesus, reaching out to those in 
              need with love, care, and practical support. Rooted in God's call to serve others, we strive to meet 
              the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of individuals and families in our church and community.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our mission is to bring hope to the hurting, comfort to the brokenhearted, and help to those facing 
              life's challenges. Whether through food assistance, clothing drives, hospital visits, crisis care, 
              or prayer, we are committed to demonstrating the love of Christ in tangible ways.

            <h3>Our Compassion Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ." ‚Äì Galatians 6:2
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that compassion is not just an emotion, but an action. It's seeing a need and being moved 
              to respond. Our ministry is built on the understanding that when we serve others, we serve Christ 
              Himself, and in blessing others, we ourselves are blessed.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Impact and Outreach</h3>
            <p>
              Through partnerships with local organizations, schools, and community leaders, we extend our reach 
              to serve more families and individuals. Our goal is not just to provide temporary relief, but to 
              offer hope and resources that lead to lasting positive change in people's lives.
            </p>
            
            <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
            <p>
              Beyond joining our ministry team, there are many ways to support our work: donate non-perishable 
              food items, contribute gently used clothing, provide financial support for emergency assistance, 
              or simply pray for our ministry and those we serve.
