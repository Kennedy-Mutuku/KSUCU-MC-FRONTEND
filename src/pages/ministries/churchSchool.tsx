            <h2>About Church School Ministry</h2>
            <p>
              The Church-School Ministry is dedicated to building a bridge between our church and local schools, 
              fostering relationships that reflect God's love and make a lasting impact on students, teachers, 
              and families. This ministry exists to serve, support, and inspire the next generation by meeting 
              practical needs, encouraging spiritual growth, and sharing the hope of Christ.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Through partnerships with schools, we provide mentorship, tutoring, prayer support, and resources 
              that enhance both academic success and personal development. Whether through after-school programs, 
              teacher appreciation initiatives, or outreach events, our goal is to create an environment where 
              faith, education, and community come together to transform lives.

            <h3>Our Education Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." ‚Äì Proverbs 22:6
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that education is a partnership between school, family, church, and community. By working 
              together, we can provide students with the academic support, life skills, and moral foundation they 
              need to succeed not just in school, but in life.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Community Impact</h3>
            <p>
              Our ministry has touched hundreds of lives through tutoring, mentorship, and support programs. 
              We've seen students improve their grades, gain confidence, and develop positive life goals. 
              Teachers and parents consistently report the positive impact our volunteers have on their students.
